In the Spring of 2019 I worked with a team of 4 other Georgia State University students to analyze the 
training data of Canada's Olympic Women's Rugby Team to see if there was any way to increase the win rate of the team.

Basic regression techniques were used and primarily done with R in RStudio.

The program where I learned R commands and the data working will be put here.

Unfortunately I can not upload the actual Data that the analysis was conducted on as I had to sign an NDA.
